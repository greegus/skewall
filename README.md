# skewall
A simple tool for compensating skewed projection area.

I recently had this struggle with fitting the projected image to match the background on the projection screen but the data projector itself can't be placed on the right spot to face the projection screen directly. This tool is an ad-hoc on-site solution to that. 

Many thanks to Franklin Ta (fta2012) and his CSS matrix transformation script.
